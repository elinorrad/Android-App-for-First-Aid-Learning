# Android-App-for-First-Aid-Learning
This is a final high school graduation project for my 5 unit Computer Science track, expected to be completed by July 2025.


The app is designed to teach basic first aid principles through an interactive and user friendly Android experience. It is currently in development and will serve as a tool for self paced learning and review.

**ðŸŽ“ Project Info**



This project is part of my matriculation in Computer Science (5 units), and is submitted as part of the final grade. It's an individual project developed entirely 
by me, as a twelfth grade student.



**ðŸ’¡ Future Plans**



* Add more first aid topics

* Improve UX based on feedback


**ðŸš€ If you want to run the code**


If you want to run the application, you can open a new user, or log in as an administrator user to get an administrator screen to edit+add+delete content.

To get an administrator user, contact elinorrad@gmail.com

An example of the application's activity as an administrator appears in a video in this repository
